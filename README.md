# MutationTools
Collected methods of mutation detection from WGS/WES

## Mutation software
- [scalpel](http://scalpel.sourceforge.net/manual.html): Find (somatic or de novo) indel from WGS/WES 
- [MuSiC2](https://github.com/ding-lab/MuSiC2):Identifying mutational significance in cancer genomes

## Mutation & pathway enrichment

## Driver mutation from Cancer sequencing data set of multiple samples ()
- [MuSiC-SMG/MutSigCV](http://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/genepattern/modules/docs/MutSigCV) 
- [Docker-MutSigCV](https://hub.docker.com/r/argrosso/mutsigcv/)
Identify genes mutated more frequently than background mutation rate based on patient-based factors and genomic position-based factors.
- The patient-based factors include:
overall mutation rate
overall mutational spectrum (e.g., the percentages of mutations that are transitions of certain types, transversions of certain types, and/or nonsense)
- The genomic position-based factors include:
gene expression levels.
DNA replication timing.
HiC-based chromatin state estimation.
